JSON::Relaxed
    Version 0.01 Nov 30, 2014

      Initial version.

    Version 0.02 Dec 3, 2014

      Fixed test.t so that it can load lib.pm when it runs.

      Added $parser->extra_tokens_ok(). Removed error code
      invalid-structure-opening-string and allowed that error to fall
      through to multiple-structures.

      Cleaned up documentation.

    Version 0.03 Dec 6, 2014

      Modified test for parse_chars to normalize newlines. Apparently the
      way Perl on Windows handles newline is different than what I
      expected, but as long as it's recognizing newlines and|or carriage
      returns then the test should pass.
