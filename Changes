JSON::Relaxed

Version: 0.051

IMPORTANT NOTICE: TAKEOVER

    New maintainer will continue development provided it is possible
    to raise the minimal perl version to 5.26.

    This version if JSON::Relaxed has no functional changes from 0.05
    but only adds the 5.26 requirement. If users depend on this module
    to be functional on ancient versions of perl the takeover will be
    cancelled, the old version requirement restored, and a new module
    (different name) will be released for future development.
